JAVA-101 (INCOMPLETE!)

Introduction

Welcome to the "Introduction to OOP with JAVA. Hands-on Exercises!" repository. This repository contains solutions to a set of exercises related to JAVA fundamentals. These exercises belong to my professor in charge of the class (OOP-JAVA), and I'm providing solutions as part of my learning journey and to help fellow learners understand Java programming concepts better.

About the Exercises

The exercises included in this repository cover various aspects of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Java. They are designed to reinforce fundamental concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and more.

Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

    Each exercise is organized into its own directory (week 1, week 2 etc).
    Within each exercise directory, you'll find:
        Java source code files (*.java) containing the solution code.
        Additional instructions or alternative methods to solve a problem if applicable.

Feel free to study the solutions, experiment with the code, and use them as a reference to deepen your understanding of Java programming and object-oriented principles.
